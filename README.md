# C-Programming-Practices
My self-study journey in C and C++ programming languages. Probably a recap/review of coding in C/C++ for the past course where we studied this language as a computer engineering student.

### Initial Pre-requisites
- Install GCC *(for C compiler)*
- Install Visual Studio Code *(as main IDE)*
- Install the following VSCode Extensions:
1. C/C++ *C/C++ IntelliSense, debugging, and code browsing*
2. Code Runner *Run C, C++, etc.*
